## Getting Started

To set up a local version of this project, a collection of steps have been put together to help guide you from installations to usage. Simply follow the guide below and you'll be up and running in no time.

### Set up Project

- Install [the Ruby programming language](https://ruby-doc.org/downloads/), if you haven't already.
- - Install [the Ruby on Rails MVC Framework](https://rubyonrails.org/), if you haven't already.
- Open Terminal
- Navigate to the preferred location/folder you want the app on your local machine. Use `cd <file-path>` for this.
- Run `git clone https://github.com/Moreneecoder/soccer-info.git` to download the project source code.
- Now that you have a local copy of the project, navigate to the root of the project folder from your terminal.
- Run `bundle install` to install all dependencies in the Gemfile file.

### Set up Database

```

### Other Dependencies

- This project's user interface is built with [Bootstrap v5](https://getbootstrap.com/), run `yarn add boostrap` to simply set this up.
- Media assets (image storage and serving) for this project is handled by [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/), to set this up, create an account and enter the details of your cloudinary api keys in the .env file as detailed further below.
